# Overview
Shell completions are created here and referenced by omz/zsh config.

# Dynamic completions
Oftentimes tools will provide a way to dynamically generate completions; these
are automated whenever possible in scruth-config.

However consider if an oh-my-zsh plugin already exists for the tool and simply add that to the ohmyzsh
config (in scruth-config) first.  Otherwise, can also create a custom plugin and add that to the plugins
list.
